# Code
You find here the code for our simulation. Note that depending on your compiler, the display of the nation after every time iteration might have to be closed manually (comment the relative lines if this is not desired). In order to have an interactive HTML output you need plotly which can be installed with `$ pip install plotly==4.14.1`.
